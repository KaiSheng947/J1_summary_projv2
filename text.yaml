        The velvet tables are torn, the cards brittle and yellowed. 
        A cold draft circles the room as if unseen players are still seated. 
        The faint clink of coins drops into nothingness, but no winnings remain. 
        A spectral dealer gestures at the cards—you must place your bet.

        Baccarat game - Rules:
        1. There will be 2 hands dealt out called Player and Banker.
        2. The person betting can choose whether to bet on Player, Banker, Tie.
        3. Each hand will have a value calculated from the 2 cards. 
        4. The winning hand will be the hand in which its value is closest to nine. The other result is a Tie.
        5. Hence, the player is essentially betting on the outcome of the comparison between both hands. 
        6. Another rule is natural 8 and 9s. If either or both hands have natural 8s or 9s, the comparison is made to find the winner.
        7. If there are no natural 8s or 9s, a third card will be drawn and the comparison is made. The game ends.
        
  blackjack:

            The blackjack tables are coated in dust, cards frozen mid-game as if abandoned in terror. 
            A faint whisper of shuffling chips echoes, though no one is there. 
            The dealer’s chair rocks slowly on its own. 
            A skeletal hand pushes a stack of chips toward you—you’re expected to play.

            Room 1: Blackjack - Rules
            1. You and the bot will receive two cards each. You will get to see one of the bot’s cards.
            2. The goal is to get a hand closest to 21 without going over it. Going over 21 is called a bust.

            4. During your turn, you can choose whether to draw another card or not. The bot will draw if their hand is below 17.
            5. Whoever’s hand is closer to 21 without going over it wins.
            6. If the dealer busts, the player wins. If it’s a tie, the player loses.

                  Cigarette smoke lingers in the empty air, though the room has been sealed for years. 
                  The poker chips rattle faintly, stacking and unstacking themselves in the silence. \
                  Shadows lean closer around the green felt. 
                  A ghostly voice rasps, “Your seat is waiting.”
    rules: |
            1. The Player and Dealer is dealt 3 cards
            2. The cards are then compared using the rules of poker

                  A single chair waits beneath a flickering light, its shadow stretching unnaturally long. 
                  On the table rests a revolver, polished as if freshly cleaned, six empty glasses arranged beside it like spectators. 
                  The air tastes metallic, every breath heavy with dread. 
                  An unseen presence loads a single round, the click echoing far too loud. The weapon slides toward you across the table—you are expected to take your turn.
    rules: |
            1. The gun has six chambers and x amount of bullets
            2. You and the Pit Boss will each take turns shooting yourself with the gun
            3. Don't Die

              The game is over, thanks for playing!
  GAME_LOSE: | 
              A hush falls over the ruined hall. 
              The undead dealers stand still, their empty sockets fixed on you. 
              Then, as one, they laugh—a hollow, rattling chorus—as cards slice through the air like blades. 
              You collapse, claimed by the house, your name etched forever into its ledger of the damned.
  GAME_WIN: |
              The silence breaks—not with laughter, but with retreat. 
              The figures that surrounded you shudder, crack, and collapse, their bones scattering like brittle coins across the floor. 
              The air clears, heavy no longer, and you stand alone where death once ruled.
  WELCOME: |
            You must have drunk too much. The last thing you remember is the burn of liquor, the blur of neon lights, and then—blackness.
            Now you wake in silence. The air is stale, thick with dust and decay. Faded carpets stretch into darkness, and the broken chandeliers above sway though there is no wind. The walls groan as if alive, and from the corners of the room, pale eyes gleam, watching.
            The doors behind you are locked. The casino has you now. Once a place of chance and fortune, it has become a mausoleum of the restless dead.
            You cannot leave. The house has claimed you.
            Only by surviving four games will the grip of this place loosen. Until then, you are both a guest... and a prisoner.
